# Canonical Homebrew cask for Clyde.
#
# This file is the source of truth. On every signed release, the
# release workflow runs scripts/release/update-cask.sh to stamp in the
# new version + DMG sha256 and pushes the result to
# https://github.com/kl0sin/homebrew-tap so users can
#
#     brew tap kl0sin/tap
#     brew install --cask clyde
#
# To bump by hand, run:
#     scripts/release/update-cask.sh path/to/Clyde-x.y.z.dmg
#
# The script rewrites the `version "..."` and `sha256 "..."` lines in
# place — keep their format intact.
